Varner, 2013). &nbsp;This research attempts to identify practical ways for libraries to involve themselves in DH projects and includes recommendations for further research that would align the librarian&rsquo;s role with the role of Digital Humanists, but the competencies needed for such involvement and reframing of librarianship are not easily identified.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0 c1">In </span><span class="c0 c11">Supporting Digital Scholarship in Research Libraries: Scalability and Sustainability</span><span class="c0 c1">, the authors</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;describe </span><span class="c0">NYU scholars&rsquo;

cognitive, functional and behavioral. &nbsp;Therefore, the term competency as used in the context of this study will be defined as having three components; knowledge (cognitive), skills (functional) and attitudes (behavioral). &nbsp;Furthermore, and as seen within the literature review, staff within academic libraries engaging with digital humanities researchers are combining knowledge, skills and attitudes towards a holistic approach to their engagement with this type of researcher.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">For the purposes of this a study a formal definition of the term digital scholarship as used in the LIS academic context is appropriate. &nbsp;The Scholarly Communications Institute at the University of Virginia defines this term </span><span class="c0 c1">as &ldquo;the use of digital evidence and method, digital authoring, digital publishing, digital curation and preservation, and digital use and reuse of scholarship&rdquo; (Smith, 2011). &nbsp;This definition is in use by current practitioners in the field of LIS authoring articles on the subject of supporting digital scholarship services in academic libraries, and this article is found within a special issue of the Journal of Library Administration discussing Digital Humanities in libraries, therefore using this definition within the context of this study can be deemed appropriate (Vinopal &amp; McCormick, 2013).</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c4">Literature Review</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">The focus of this literature review are the competencies for staff within academic libraries offering digital scholarship services to digital humanities researchers, with a purpose of establishing the context and rationale for these competencies. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">This topic originates from within academic research libraries and those who engage with digital humanities researchers. &nbsp;It was felt that constructing this literature review section into sub-sections based on their focus of digital scholarship services to digital humanities researchers would be an appropriate way to extract a context and rationale for these competencies and reveal an understanding of a definition of the term. &nbsp;The sub-sections are categorized by the following focuses; conceptual and functional. &nbsp;The conceptual section pulls together those articles focusing on an understanding of the topic and the functional section pulls together those articles focusing on applied skill within the context of this topic.</span></p><p class="c2 c9 c8"><span class="c0 c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c11 c4 c1">Conceptual</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0 c1">Fay and Nyhan (2015) identify</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and contextualize types of knowledge created between the DH and library sector, constructing their findings through case studies and user testing. &nbsp;Their findings in </span><span class="c0 c11 c1">Webbs on the Web: libraries, digital humanities and collaboration</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;include that an understanding of complementary skills between librarians and DH researchers will lead to better digital scholarly resources and that both sets of skills brought to usability testing enhanced the usability of the resources. &nbsp;Although the authors argue that by providing concrete examples in practice between library and information sciences and DH will stimulate cross-institutional collaborations, the paper itself does little advance the skills needed to facilitate such collaborations. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">Lindquist, Long and Watkins (2015) pose the question, &ldquo;How do we know what type and level of involvement might be most impactful for libraries and campuses surrounding DH?,&rdquo; to guide the the University Libraries&rsquo; Digital Humanities Task Force in their assessment of digital humanities interest and needs on their campus. &nbsp;The findings in </span><span class="c0 c11">Designing a Digital Humanities Strategy Using Data-Driven Assessment Methods</span><span class="c0">, are quite robust, concluding that librarians can fulfill a vital need in supporting instructional technology and working with faculty to use technology more creatively in the classroom. &nbsp;There is also assertions that multidisciplinary interest in the digital humanities is strong and siloing support networks could prohibit interdisciplinary collaboration. &nbsp;However, the role of pedagogy in librarianship surrounding DH services in this context is not supported by the identification of the skill set necessary to accomplishing such goals, nor are the skills identified that are necessary to support collaboration.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">Nowviskie (2013), as stated in the introduction, describes </span><span class="c0 c1">the role of Scholars&rsquo; Lab, and the role of librarians, along the &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c11 c1">path to publication</span><span class="c0 c1">&rdquo; for DH scholars as one engaging with diametrical and simultaneous courses. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c15 c1">Embedded in this article via the </span><span class="c0 c11 c15 c1">path to production </span><span class="c0 c1 c15">analogy are the opportunities for library engagement &ldquo;as scholarly R&amp;D&rdquo; and to understand digital humanities &ldquo;as method&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0">Nowviskie, 2013, </span><span class="c0 c15 c1">p.55). &nbsp;The author asks the reader to replace the term &ldquo;developers&rdquo; with &ldquo;scholars&rdquo; and &ldquo;sysadmins&rdquo; with &ldquo;librarians&rdquo; for clarity, as well as entertaining a &ldquo;non-teleological conception of the phrase, &ldquo;path to production&rdquo;&rdquo; (p.55). &nbsp;The author </span><span class="c10 c21">presents a descriptive narrative of a specific case eloquently and well structured, engaging the reader to stage</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;open, well-informed, and honest conversations about how any particular scholarly path should wend. &nbsp;However, leveraging from this article the skill set and components necessary to embark on such a path is quite challenging, yet worthwhile to extract, which compels one to seek out information which may generate a consensus on these skills sets from experts in the field.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">Posner (2013) outlines in </span><span class="c0 c11 c1">No Half Measures: Overcoming Common Challenges to Doing Digital Humanities in the Library</span><span class="c0 c1">, </span><span class="c0">common sources of frustration for library professionals engaged in digital humanities work, using this framework to support their assertion that the common support model is inadequate. &nbsp;The author compares the service-and-support approach versus collaboration, offering sketches of some library-based digital humanities programs that are working to address these challenges, but these compelling findings are limited in the number of identifiable skills needed by librarians to value, support and sustain the projects brought to the doors of the library by digital humanists.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">Sula (2013), as stated in the introduction, contextualizes points of connection between libraries and DH to highlight the areas in which the library can provide service and support and where collaboration can occur. Building off this conceptual model, the author&rsquo;s findings show that points of connection between libraries and DH were varied and often dependent on the particular needs of faculty members. &nbsp;The author states an apology for their methodologies inability to make generalizations, which perhaps leaves an opportunity to further the conversation in this area through methods which are well suited as a means and method for consensus-building.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">Kretzschmar and Potter (2010) propose that collaboration with the university library is the only realistic option for long-term sustainability of digital humanities projects in the current environment. &nbsp;In the article, </span><span class="c0 c11">Library collaboration with large digital humanities projects</span><span class="c0">, the authors analyze case studies which involve academic institutions supporting large digital humanities project. &nbsp;The emerging themes are as follows; Integration (DH project aligns with mission of library), Distinction between tools and content, Resource sharing, and the sustainability of a project relies on continuity of both the developer as a human resource and funding as a material resource. &nbsp;The collection of data used to support the findings, which are based in the evaluation of DH processes that are or envisioned to be integrated into the library archival work flow, could possibly be structured in a way that identifies specific competencies required of such projects. &nbsp;With the authors extensive knowledge on the topic and research already in place, their involvement in a study which could identify such competencies is a worthwhile venture.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">The articles summarized here do well at articulating their research objectives, however in each article a clear and concise skill set necessary for staff providing service and support in this specific context is difficult to extract. &nbsp;This statement is not a negative critique on the authors research or a statement to undermine the contributions made to this emerging and interesting field, but instead meant to support the purpose of the proposed study: extracting a consensus of competencies and to correlate information judgements on the topic. &nbsp;Emerging themes from these articles are collaboration</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(as seen in the Fay and Nyhan article), the role of pedagogy (as seen in the Lindquist, Long and Watkins paper), and reframing the libraries role within the context of DH service and support (as seen in Nowviskie, Posner, and Sula). &nbsp;The next set of articles discussed from the literature review also do well at articulating their research objectives, but focus more on applied skill than conceptualizing the topic.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c4"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c11 c4"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c11 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c11 c4">Functional</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">Rutner and Schonfeld (2012), authors of </span><span class="c0 c11 c1">Supporting the Changing Research Practices of Historians</span><span class="c11 c1 c13">, </span><span class="c0">examine the changing research methods and practices of academic historians and then identified services to better support them. &nbsp;This article gives relevant insight into the current state of research practices, concluded that underlying research methods for historians seemed unchanged, but day-to-day research practices have changed. &nbsp;They identified opportunities for improved support from libraries;

needs and digital scholarship support at other research institutions in their article, </span><span class="c0 c11 c1">Supporting Digital Scholarship in Research Libraries: Scalability and Sustainability</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;It introduces a service model developed for supporting such services and discusses the challenges to research libraries of implementing this service model in a scalable, sustainable way, by addressing project and tool selection, staffing, and organizational change. &nbsp;The authors drew on their understanding of practice and trends and their findings included the need for Enterprise academic tools, Standardized Research Services (e.g. institution-wide Wordpress service; having limited templates/approved plugins), Service Level Agreements, enhanced research services, and applied R&amp;D. &nbsp;This high-level service model is not prescriptive, as the authors assert that digital scholarship support are inherently diverse. &nbsp;Thus, planning must be guided by local considerations, specifically the entire research process and one must consider scale and sustainability.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">These articles establish ways to accomplish certain goals at the intersection of research, technology and libraries, the three components embodied by researchers in the Digital Humanities (Lindquist, Long, &amp; Watkins, 2015</span><span class="c0 c1">), but there are gaps in knowledge on the specific skills (those which </span><span class="c0">incorporate the three elements defined previously; cognitive, functional and behavioral) needed to accomplish these goals. &nbsp;With the literature providing a holistic view on the topic, providing insight into the context and rationale for those offering digital scholarship services at the intersection of research and technology in the library space, but deficient in clear and concise set of competencies to be of service, support or a full-on collaborator, the purpose for a study which can potentially produce such a listing of skills is justifiable.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c4">Methodology</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">The study chosen relates to the researcher&#39;s position and beliefs about the nature of existence and the application of knowledge with the assumption that there are multiple realities that cannot be separated from the contexts, people, and language that create and interpret them. &nbsp;This would be described as a pragmatic world view. &nbsp;This basic philosophical assumption is grounded in &ldquo;a means for exploring and understanding the meaning individuals or groups ascribe to social or human problem&rdquo; (Creswell, 2013). &nbsp;These philosophical assumptions position the researcher to approach research design with qualitative methods.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0 c1">The methodological approach chosen to develop this research is qualitative. &nbsp;After a comprehensive literature review, an expert panel will be defined. Subsequently, a two round Delphi study will be conducted to identify competencies using an online questionnaire survey. Participants are experts on the topic, coming from a range of institutions. A research-based, principal list of competencies for information professionals will be produced.</span></p><p class="c2 c9 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c4">Delphi Study</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">The strategy of inquiry for this investigation will be a Delphi study, as this design would be a suitable study for this research topic because of its ability to reach a consensus through a highly structured design (Pickard, 2013). &nbsp;This design is suitable since the purpose is to gain an expert opinion (i.e. competency requirements) from experts (i.e. staff within academic research libraries) in a specific field (i.e. digital scholarship services to humanities researchers). &nbsp;The topic is also in an infancy stage. The field is still emerging, therefore identifying competency requirements for staff within academic libraries offering digital scholarship services to digital humanities researchers would benefit from a technique that attempts to address &ldquo;what could/should be&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;what is&rdquo; (Miller, 2006).</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c4"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c4">Panel Selection</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">A thorough review of the relevant literature and documentation demonstrates that those who would be invited to participate in the study are knowledgeable of and comprehend the following subjects; (1) digital scholarship services and (2) digital humanities researchers. &nbsp;The approach of identifying the panel based on their qualifications, which were extracted from a thorough review of literature, is an appropriate approach (Hsu and Sandford, 2007). &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The current literature reviewed for this study allows for the identification of nineteen panel members, which is an appropriate number after reviewing a study with similar aims. &nbsp;A study with the aim to define the competency requirements for digital curators, and to validate a Delphi process in the context of Library, Archives, Museum curriculum development used the following statement to assert their position on the number of panel members used:</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">According to </span><span class="c0"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057231713000106%23bib41&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1462621750989000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKtrl_VyFlf4FJ9-PgRG7YI3PtSQ">Thangaratinam and Redman (2005</a></span><span class="c0">:120), &ldquo;there are no hard and fast rules&rdquo; on the size of the panel, &ldquo;&hellip;representation is assessed by the qualities of the expert panel than its numbers&rdquo;.

C., &amp; Sandford, B. A., 2007, p. 2), participant anonymity is a characteristic and advantage of the Delphi process, which can reduce the effects of dominant individuals during group-based processes, however since this is an emergent field of study and their are a small number of experts qualified to participate, participants may know of one another based on current literature on the topic and interactions via conferences or other academic arenas for communication. &nbsp;This issue of confidentiality can be addressed through anonymity between participants during each iteration of the process and made easier by geographic dispersion and electronic communication. &nbsp;In terms of data collected, the use of statistical analysis will &ldquo;allow for an objective and impartial analysis and summarization of the collected data (Hsu, C. C., &amp; Sandford, B. A., 2007, p. 2).</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">Another ethical consideration worth discussing is the perception from from the desired panel participants on this study&rsquo;s identification of a deficiency in the literature where the literature in question is written by those asked to participate in the study. &nbsp;Since this could be problematic, the research will have this proposal reviewed by colleagues to gain outside perspective on whether this issue would in fact </span><span class="c0 c11">be</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;an issue to those asked to be a part of the expert panel. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c4">Practical aspects:</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c4"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">Conducting a Delphi study can be time-consuming, with a minimum of 45 days for the administration of this research method, with two weeks given to the Delphi participants to respond to each round (Delbecq et al,. 1975 as cited in Hsu, C. C., &amp; Sandford, B. A., 2007, p. 4). &nbsp;The researcher is aware of the time requirement for the study and has made a timeline in the appendix of this research proposal. &nbsp;The proposed timeline allows participants the recommended two weeks to respond to each round and the calculated duration of time between the start and end of the study is over the minimum 45 days.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c4">Conclusion:</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0 c4"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0">As stated previously, the expected contributions from this study will be a more precise conclusion to the literature already in existence on the topic. &nbsp;This comes from an extensive literature review identifying a gap in a specific type of knowledge (</span><span class="c10">gaining an expert opinion (i.e. </span><span class="c10 c11">competency requirements</span><span class="c10">) from experts (i.e. </span><span class="c10 c11">staff within academic research libraries</span><span class="c10">) in a specific field (i.e. </span><span class="c10 c11">digital scholarship services to humanities researchers</span><span class="c10">)),</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">which supports the need for a master list of competencies for staff offering digital scholarship services to digital humanities researchers. </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The expected output of this research will be a master list of </span><span class="c0">competencies and meaningful representations of the numerical data produced from this study. &nbsp;As with any research study, there are limitations. &nbsp;Potential limitations to this research that can have the greatest impact on the quality of the findings are the subjects chosen to participate in the study. &nbsp;Although the researcher has rigorously investigated the qualifications of the Delphi subjects, there can be no guarantee that the targeted sample will produce the desired outcome of the study. &nbsp;Overall the Delphi technique has the potential of identifying the consensus on the part of the study group and to correlate informed judgements on the proposed topic, therefore it is expected that this study will produce credible and valid findings that will benefit practitioners in the field; staff within academic research libraries offering digital scholarship services to digital humanities researchers, library managers needing to recruit or develop staff to work in this area, and faculty in LIS programs needing to design or develop curricula for courses to prepare new professionals to work in the area</span><span class="c0 c4">. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c12"><span class="c0 c4">References</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0">Fay, E. , C. , Nyhan, J.
