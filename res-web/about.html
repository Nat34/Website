				<p>I hold a bachelor of fine arts from the university of illinois at chicago and master's degree in library and information science from the university of pittsburgh.  Currently my artist practice embraces arbitrary systems influencing off-the-shelf color arrangments.  I explore methodical processes and mathematical systems which function as determinants.  This practice has had a profound influence from my graduate studies, specifically engagements with programming language and creative code.</p>
				<p>My work in the field of library and information sciences focuses on technology, instruction, web services and content, and serving the increasingly diverse and multicultural population by extending innovative and creative uses of library and archival resources to all.</p>
				<p>
				More broadly, my professional work and artistic practice meets at the intersection of technology and creativity.  I am practicularly interested in the support structures existing in both these areas - those things which frame, present, and construct, and those which guide, organize and facilitate.</p>
